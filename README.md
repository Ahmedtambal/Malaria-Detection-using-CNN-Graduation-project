# Malaria-Detection-using-CNN-Graduation-project
Implementation of a deep learning model for leukemia classification and malaria detection using CNNs. The model utilizes transfer learning with VGG19 and InceptionV3 architectures, trained on custom datasets. The code includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of performance metrics. Achieved high accuracy
